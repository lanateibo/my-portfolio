        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Lana, and I am 20 years old. In 2022, I studied Networking and Security Analysis at Mohawk College,
             where I gained valuable knowledge in networking and coding. Unfortunately, I was unable to complete the program
              due to unforeseen circumstances. Currently, I am a student at Humber College, pursuing a degree in Computer Programming. 
              I have learned a great deal about coding and remain eager to deepen my understanding and explore new areas of the field.

                        <p>I completed an HTML and CSS course at Mohawk College, where we focused on developing various types of webpages using only HTML and CSS. 
                            The course taught me how to structure content with HTML and style it with CSS to create functional and visually appealing designs. 
                            We worked in Notepad++, allowing me to gain hands-on experience coding from scratch. This course provided a strong foundation in 
                            web development and enhanced my understanding of clean coding and web design principles.</p>

                    <button class="click-details">Show Details</button>
                    <div class="project-details" style="display: none;">
                        <p>In creating my portfolio website, I applied everything I learned throughout my web development course to showcase my skills. The website is divided into three distinct sections, each demonstrating different techniques I mastered.

                            In the About Me section, I utilized simple padding and spacing to arrange the text in a visually pleasing and organized way. This approach ensured that the content is easy to read and aesthetically appealing.
                            
                            For the Projects section, I implemented a Dynamic Project Gallery using Flexbox, which allows for a responsive layout and interactive functionality. This gallery enables users to explore my projects in a more engaging and fluid way, making the experience both user-friendly and visually dynamic.
                            
                            By integrating these techniques, Iâ€™ve built a portfolio that not only highlights my learning but also reflects my ability to create clean, responsive, and well-structured websites.</p>
